              Every experienced software developer knows someone who double
              majored in English and music, played in a band, worked in retail,
              changed careers, took a coding bootcamp, changed careers again and
              found themselves working in tech. Thatâ€™s me.<br></br>
              <br></br>I am experienced with HTML/CSS, JS, React, MySQL, SQL
              Server, MongoDB, Azure, Netlify, and Git. I am continuously
              learning and am eager to tackle technical and design challenges to
              create simple, elegant, and functional applications.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Currently, I am focused on learning React and am excited to expand
              my skills as a developer.
